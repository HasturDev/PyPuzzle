# PyPuzzle
Using PyTest, this library will allow other developers to create tests that can be placed inside of the tests folder and called by users.
Please place all tests inside of the tests folders and add a description to the introduction dictionary. 
I know this is basic now, but it will be improved over time by me if no one else
